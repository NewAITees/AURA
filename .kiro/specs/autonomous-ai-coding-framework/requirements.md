# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Project AURA (Autonomous Unified Research Assistant) is an autonomous local AI coding framework designed to leverage RTX 4090 hardware for continuous, secure, and collaborative AI-driven software development. The system will feature multi-agent collaboration, secure execution environments, and long-term autonomous operation capabilities, enabling developers to delegate complex coding tasks to specialized AI agents working in coordination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local LLM Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust local LLM infrastructure, so that I can run AI coding assistants without relying on external services and maintain full control over my code and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize Ollama server with stable connectivity
2. WHEN switching between models THEN the system SHALL support both Llama 3.1 8B (development) and Mixtral 8x7B (production) with automatic model management
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 10 seconds for code generation tasks
4. WHEN running continuously THEN the system SHALL achieve 99% uptime over 24-hour periods
5. IF VRAM usage exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to a lighter model

### Requirement 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specialized AI agents that work together, so that complex coding tasks can be broken down and handled by experts in different areas like code generation, review, testing, and integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a coding task is initiated THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate specialized agents (Code Generator, Code Reviewer, Tester, Integration Manager)
2. WHEN agents collaborate THEN they SHALL communicate through a structured protocol with shared memory and state management
3. WHEN conflicts arise between agents THEN the system SHALL resolve them through priority-based decision making
4. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
5. IF a task requires parallel processing THEN multiple agents SHALL execute sub-tasks concurrently

### Requirement 3: Secure Execution Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-generated code to run in a secure, isolated environment, so that my system remains protected from potentially harmful code while still allowing productive development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing AI-generated code THEN the system SHALL run it within Docker containers with restricted permissions
2. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL limit access to designated project directories only
3. WHEN network access is required THEN the system SHALL implement network isolation and filtering
4. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately halt execution and log the incident
5. IF advanced security is enabled THEN the system SHALL use Firejail for additional sandboxing layers

### Requirement 4: Long-term Autonomous Operation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to operate autonomously for extended periods, so that I can delegate long-running development tasks without constant supervision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running for extended periods THEN the system SHALL implement memory leak prevention and automatic cleanup
2. WHEN system health degrades THEN automated health checks SHALL trigger recovery procedures
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before escalating to user notification
4. WHEN logs accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement automatic log rotation and archival
5. IF the system becomes unresponsive THEN it SHALL automatically restart affected components

### Requirement 5: Project Integration and Context Awareness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to understand my existing projects and coding patterns, so that generated code follows project conventions and integrates seamlessly with existing codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing in a project THEN the system SHALL scan and analyze existing code structure and patterns
2. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL follow detected project conventions and coding styles
3. WHEN working with dependencies THEN the system SHALL respect existing package management and requirements
4. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL place them in appropriate directories following project structure
5. IF project context changes THEN the system SHALL update its understanding and adapt accordingly

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with my development workflow, so that I can easily initiate tasks, monitor progress, and review results without disrupting my normal development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating tasks THEN the system SHALL provide a simple command-line interface with intuitive commands
2. WHEN tasks are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress monitoring and status updates
3. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL present results in a reviewable format with clear change summaries
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with suggested fixes
5. IF multiple tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL manage task prioritization and resource allocation

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring of the AI system's behavior and performance, so that I can understand what the system is doing and optimize its performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are active THEN the system SHALL log all agent actions and decisions with timestamps
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track response times, resource usage, and success rates
3. WHEN displaying system status THEN a web dashboard SHALL show real-time agent activity and system health
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide historical data and trend analysis
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert users and suggest optimization actions

### Requirement 8: Self-Improvement Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn from its successes and failures, so that it becomes more effective over time and adapts to my specific development needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the results
2. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL optimize prompts and strategies based on historical performance
3. WHEN user feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into future decision-making
4. WHEN improvements are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest and implement optimizations
5. IF learning data accumulates THEN the system SHALL maintain a knowledge base for continuous improvement
